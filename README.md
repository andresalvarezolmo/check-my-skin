# check-my-skin
## Description
This project serves as spin-off of my Honours Project. It pretends to implement a Proof-of-Concept where users can submit skin mole images through a webapp and get a prediction made by a CNN (EfficientNetB4). This could serve dermatologists screen more patients every day and spot early cases of skin cancer, thus reducing mortality.

## Get set up
- Navigate to the directory and run `docker-compose` up to spin off the services. 
- Frontend will be available in [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend will be running in [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Project in construction...
The current state of the project will soon be visible at [andresalvarezolmo.com](andresalvarezolmo.com). CI/CD construction still in progress.
